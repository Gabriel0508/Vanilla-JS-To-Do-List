# Vanilla-JS-To-Do-List
I used Vanilla JavaScript to create certain content in HTML and mostly for the functionality in the application.

The purpose of creating this application was to improve my ability to work with objects in JavaScript as well as to manipulate the DOM.

I created the TODO application following the JavaScript course I took on Udemy Academy. 

As functionality you can add a new item, you can delete the item, you can also set it as completed, you can show and hide the list of items.
